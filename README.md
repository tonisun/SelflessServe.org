## Concept
### Concept of Selfless Service Locally
Many people find themselves in need of help but lack the resources, time, or ability to seek assistance.
- Our mobile app addresses this issue by allowing users to press a red button and detail their problem, whether itâ€™s a minor inconvenience or a more significant concern.
- Conversely, those wishing to offer their help can press a blue button and instantly check if there is a neighbor in their designated area who requires support.
- The app can determine the distance between users, and, if both parties are agreeable, they can initiate a chat to discuss the situation in more detail.
- Additionally, each user who provides help will have a file where they can categorize and manage the individuals they have assisted, enabling them to keep track of who needs what, and when.

### Concept of Selfless Service Globally
Globally, when resources are available, the government should assume responsibility for providing assistance.
