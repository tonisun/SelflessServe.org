### Concept of "Nikolaus" Microservice
Many people find themselves in need of help but lack the resources, time, or ability to seek assistance.
- Our mobile app addresses this issue by allowing users to press a red button and detail their problem, whether itâ€™s a minor inconvenience or a more significant concern.
- Conversely, those wishing to offer their help can press a blue button and instantly check if there is a neighbor in their designated area who requires support.
- The app can determine the distance between users, and, if both parties are agreeable, they can initiate a chat to discuss the situation in more detail.
- Additionally, each user who provides help will have a file where they can categorize and manage the individuals they have assisted, enabling them to keep track of who needs what, and when.

### UML Diagrams
- **Class Diagrams** for the user interfaces and data models
- **Sequence Diagrams** for actions such as 'Request Help' and 'Offer Help'






### Concept of Selfless Service Globally
Globally, when resources are available, the government should assume responsibility for providing assistance.


## Prerequisites

### Technologies
- **Java Spring Boot**: The core technology stack used for building the primary application, including user registration and management.

### GitHub Project for Development
- **[SelflessServe.com GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tonisun/SelflessServe.com.git)**: The central code repository where the main application and microservices are maintained and developed.

### Main Application Features
- **User Registration and Management**: The main application handles user registration and their overall management, serving as the gateway to various microservices.

### Documentation Site
- **[SelflessServe.org](https://www.selflessserve.org)**: This website serves as the main hub for documentation, guiding developers and users alike.

### Project Objective
- **Microservices Development by Contributors**: The idea is to have developers contribute well-documented microservices that can easily be integrated into the main application. These services aim to facilitate selfless acts of service, aligning with the project's motto that "The Human is central with their basic needs for the development of services."
